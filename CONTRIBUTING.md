## Your first pull request

1. Fork the repository on GitHub, clone your fork, and make a branch off `main`:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/enterprise-agent-toolkit.git
   cd enterprise-agent-toolkit
   git checkout -b fix/short-description
   ```

2. Make your change. Try to keep each pull request to one thing (one fix, one guide, one component). Smaller pull requests get reviewed a lot faster.

3. Run the [checks](#checks) that apply to what you changed. If you only touched docs, you can skip this.

4. Commit and push:

   ```bash
   git commit -am "Fix pgvector teardown when the namespace is already gone"
   git push origin fix/short-description
   ```

5. Open a pull request against `main` in `intel/enterprise-agent-toolkit`. Tell us what you changed, why, and how you tested it.

The automated checks will run, and a maintainer will review it.

---

## Checks

Every pull request runs Ansible Lint, ShellCheck, Trivy, Checkov, Bandit, and Dependency Review. You'll save yourself a round trip if you run the relevant ones before you push:

```bash
# Ansible roles
pip install ansible-lint
ansible-lint --skip-list name,var-naming,fqcn,yaml,jinja,key-order roles/

# Helm charts
helm lint charts/<name>

# Shell scripts
shellcheck -x path/to/script.sh

# Any YAML you edited
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('components.yaml'))"
```

### Testing on a cluster

If you changed anything in `roles/` or `charts/`, please try it on a scratch cluster with [Stack Manager](https://github.com/intel/enterprise-ai-solutions). Point Stack Manager at your branch, then from the Stack Manager directory run:

```bash
./stack-manager install agent-toolkit -- --check   # shows the install order without changing anything
./stack-manager install <component>
./stack-manager validate <component>
./stack-manager install <component>                 # second run should report zero "changed"
./stack-manager teardown <component>
./stack-manager teardown <component>                # second run should still succeed
```

Running `install` and `teardown` twice is the part that catches the most bugs. Both have to be safe to re-run.

## Add a new component

A component is one service the toolkit installs on the cluster. Redis is a component, and so is the agent sandbox. These are the ones we have today:

| Component | What it does | On by default? |
|---|---|---|
| `redis_stack` | Short-term memory: session state and caches | Yes |
| `pgvector` | Long-term memory: PostgreSQL with vector search | Yes |
| `agent_sandbox` | Isolated pods where agent-generated code runs | Yes |
| `openshell` | NVIDIA OpenShell, for stricter, policy-enforced sandboxes on top of the agent sandbox | No |
| `kuberay` | A Ray cluster for distributed Python jobs | No |
| `keycloak_agent_config` | Keycloak setup for agents | Only when Keycloak is the gateway |

So adding a component means teaching the toolkit to install one more service, like another vector database. When you run an install, Stack Manager clones this repository under `ext/` and runs each enabled component in dependency order.

Each component is made of a few pieces:

| Piece | Where it goes | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Role | `roles/<name>/` | The Ansible steps to install, check, and remove the service |
| Chart (optional) | `charts/<name>/` | The Helm chart the role deploys, committed in the repository |
| Settings | `config.yaml` | Defaults people can change, plus an on/off flag like `my_component_enabled: false` |
| Registry entry | `components.yaml` | Tells Stack Manager the component exists and what it depends on |
| Docs | `docs/<section>/`, `docs/README.md` | A short guide, linked from the docs index |

Copying an existing component, like `roles/pgvector/` and `charts/pgvector/`, is usually the fastest way to start.

### The role

```
roles/<name>/
├── tasks/
│   ├── main.yaml        Picks install, teardown, or validate
│   ├── install.yaml     Deploys the service. Must be safe to run twice
│   ├── teardown.yaml    Removes what install created. Must succeed if it's already gone
│   └── validate.yaml    Checks the service is healthy. Never changes anything
├── defaults/main.yaml   Every variable the role uses, with a default that works
└── meta/main.yaml       Metadata only. Don't add dependencies here
```

`tasks/main.yaml` is the same in every role:

```yaml
---
- name: "<name> | Dispatch action: {{ component_action }}"
  ansible.builtin.include_tasks: "{{ component_action }}.yaml"
```

Stack Manager sets `component_action` to `install`, `teardown`, or `validate`. It also passes `env_dir`, `env_name`, and `kubernetes_kubeconfig`.

### The registry entry

```yaml
components:
  - name: my_component
    layer: agent-toolkit
    enabled: "{{ my_component_enabled | default(true) | bool }}"
    depends_on: [redis_stack]
```

A few things trip people up here:

- `name` has to match the folder name under `roles/`.
- `depends_on` only lists components from this repository. You don't need to list Kubernetes or model serving; those are always installed first.
- `enabled` is evaluated before the role's defaults are loaded, so it needs its own `| default(...)` and should end with `| bool`.

### The chart

We commit charts into `charts/<name>/` so an install never has to reach an outside Helm repository. If your chart has subcharts, commit those too (as `.tgz` files under `charts/<name>/charts/`), or remove the ones you don't use. Otherwise `helm install` fails. In the role, refer to the chart with a path relative to `role_path`.

### The settings

When someone runs `init agent-toolkit`, `config.yaml` gets copied to `env/<env>/config.agent-toolkit.yaml`, and that copy is what they edit. So anything you want people to be able to change belongs in `config.yaml`.

## A few house rules

- Use the `kubernetes.core.k8s` and `kubernetes.core.helm` modules rather than calling `kubectl` or `helm` from a shell task.
- Keep variables flat, like `my_component_replicas`. Config files are merged, and a nested dictionary in one file overwrites the whole dictionary from another.
- Start variable names with your component name. Every component Stack Manager installs shares the same variable namespace.
- Never commit secrets or anything under `env/`. Generate secrets during install, or read them from a Kubernetes Secret.
- Keep LF line endings. `.gitattributes` handles this, but some copy tools sneak in CRLF, which breaks shell scripts on Linux.
- If your change affects a command, a setting, or a default, update the guide that talks about it.
